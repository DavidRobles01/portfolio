                <p class="center">Hi, my name is David Robles. I am part of a family of five 
                and the youngest. I am currently in the 10th grade at Coliseum 
                College Prep Academy. Some things that I like to do is play 
                sports, read, and hike because I like being in nature because 
                you are not being bothered by the things you would be bothered 
                by back home. Also I like pets like dogs and cats.</p>
